## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant purple (#A020F0), inspired by the high-energy Freecash site, is associated with luxury and excitement.
- Background color: Light lavender (#E6E6FA), is of the same hue family as the primary but much more desaturated, creating a gentler backdrop that prevents eye strain.
- Accent color: A complementary magenta (#FF00FF), placed about 30 degrees away from purple in the color wheel, is brighter and higher saturation than the other two.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a sans-serif with a geometric, contemporary style, offering a modern and readable typeface for headings and titles.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that offers good readability and a touch of warmth, perfect for body text.
- Utilize a set of modern and visually engaging icons sourced from 'lucide-react' to enhance the user interface and improve overall navigability. The iconography will reflect the playfulness and sophistication of a purple design theme.
- Implement a fluid, responsive grid layout using Tailwind CSS, ensuring optimal adaptability and visual harmony across various devices.
- Incorporate subtle animations using CSS transitions and transforms to enhance user experience, such as gentle fades, slides, and scaling effects.
